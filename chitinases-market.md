<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chitinases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endochitinases</li><li>Exochitinases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chitinases are enzymes that break down chitin, a key component of crustacean shells, fungal cell walls, and insect exoskeletons. The market for chitinases is divided into two primary types: endochitinases and exochitinases. Endochitinases cleave chitin molecules randomly, producing oligosaccharides, while exochitinases remove units from the ends of chitin chains. Both types find applications in agriculture, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals, promoting pest control, enhancing nutrient availability, and serving in biotechnological processes. Their increasing demand reflects growing interest in sustainable solutions across various industries.</p></p>
