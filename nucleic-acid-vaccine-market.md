<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nucleic Acid Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preventive Nucleic Acid Vaccine</li><li>Therapeutic Vucleic Acid Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nucleic acid vaccine market comprises two primary types: preventive and therapeutic vaccines. Preventive nucleic acid vaccines are designed to induce immunity against infectious diseases, helping to avert infections before they occur. They typically use plasmid DNA or mRNA to stimulate an immune response. In contrast, therapeutic nucleic acid vaccines target existing diseases, such as cancer or chronic infections, by training the immune system to recognize and attack diseased cells. Both types leverage the unique properties of nucleic acids for targeted immune responses.</p></p>
